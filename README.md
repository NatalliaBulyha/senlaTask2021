For the convenience of viewing the tasks, I made one big project with a menu. From the 
main page, you can select the task you want to start or exit the program (to exit the program, 
press "0"). After completing the task, you will be taken to the main menu, where you can continue 
working with the program and view other tasks or exit the program. You can also exit the 
application at any stage press "e".
